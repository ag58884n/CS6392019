I am Danni Huang and I tested the app of ADITYA GAJJAR.
The Min and Target versions of the SDKs are 19 and  28. 
I tested the app on an emulator with OS Nexus 5X API 24(Android 7.0, API). 
The app does not crash.
The app does display:
Hello Aditya Gajjar
And
Welcome in CS 639 Summer 2019

The name of the student is displayed.
